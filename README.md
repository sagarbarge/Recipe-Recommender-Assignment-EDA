# Problem Statement
Step into the shoes of an ML engineer working at food.com. Your job is to design a recommender system to recommend recipes to users based on their choice and the current recipe they are looking at. 

 

The recommendation engine is a way to increase the website's user engagement. If a user is shown relevant recipes, they are more likely to spend more time on your site reading about recipes. Higher user engagement will likely result in more business opportunities like collaborations, promotions, etc.

 

The performance of a recommendation engine will significantly impact the revenue your recipe site can generate. 

 

Designing a recommender from scratch is a time-consuming task.  In this assignment, you are expected to explore the data and create features that will be used to build the recommender.
